# TAB Ruby Technical Test

This project is a technical demonstration provided for [The App Business](http://theappbusiness.com).

## Testing

This project uses [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec) as its testing framework.

## Caveats

* This application uses [SQLite](http://sqlite.org)
 so as to speed up the database configuration for this example. In a real world use case for a growing application I would instead opt for [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org).
